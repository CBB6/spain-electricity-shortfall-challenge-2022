# PROBLEM STATEMENT
 * Spain has a daily energy shortfall,there is a requirement to identify patterns in the energy shortfall data to create a regression model that can accurately predict    energy shortfall.
 
# PROBLEM LANDSCAPE 
   * A regression model that is applied for the issue in Spainâ€™s energy shortfalls, is identifying patterns, predicting shortfalls, to inform the residents of Spain       when to expect electricity shortfalls.
